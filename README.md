# Multi-touch Attribution Models

## METHODOLOGY 
### 1. Heuristic models: 
 - First Touch Attribution (FTA): appoints all the credits of a conversion to the first channel of a customer journey.
 - Last Touch Attribution (LTA): similar to FTA but appoints the credits to the last channel.
 - Linear Touch Attribution (LINEAR): gives equal weight(s) to all channel(s) in a customer journey that results in conversion.
 
### 2. Markov Chain models: 
- First Order 
- Higher Order

### 3. Shapley Value method 

### 4. Logistic Regression method
