# Multi-touch Attribution Models

## METHODOLOGY 
### 1. Heuristic models
 - **First Touch Attribution (FTA)** appoints all the credits of a conversion to the first channel of a customer journey.

 - **Last Touch Attribution (LTA)** is similar to FTA but appoints the credits to the last channel.

 - **Linear Touch Attribution (LINEAR)** gives equal weight(s) to all channel(s) in a customer journey that results in conversion.

### 2. Shapley Value method 
- Assigns credits among players according to their contribution to a game.
- The Shapley Value of channel ùëñ in a sub-game ùëî is ùúô<sub>ùëñ</sub> (ùëî) 
- The attribution of channel ùëñ in a multi-channel game ùê∫:

There are some properties that the Shapley Value method needs to satisfy:
- Efficiency: The Shapley values of all players sum up to the value of the grand coalition so that the total value of the game is distributed among the players.
- Symmetry: This guarantees that players with the same contribution to every coalition should receive equal credits. 
- Dummy Player: A player that does not contribute to any coalition should receive no payoff.

### 3. Logistic Regression method 
- **The original model**: predicts conversion or no conversion given channels in a journey
- **The regularized model**: a shrinkage term is added to avoid overfitting
- The attribution of a channel is computed using Shapley Value method. 

### 4. Markov Chain models
- **First Order model** only considers the current state and ignores the sequence of the states preceding it. This property is called the Markov property or the memoryless property.

- **Higher Order models** also consider previous states of the sequence. The number of the previous states depends on the Order. For example, Second Order model would look back 2 steps in the sequence to calculate the probability of moving to the next state.
