# Multi-touch Attribution Models

## METHODOLOGY 
### 1. Heuristic models
 - First Touch Attribution (FTA): appoints all the credits of a conversion to the first channel of a customer journey.
 - Last Touch Attribution (LTA): similar to FTA but appoints the credits to the last channel.
 - Linear Touch Attribution (LINEAR): gives equal weight(s) to all channel(s) in a customer journey that results in conversion.
 
### 2. Markov Chain models
- First Order model: only considers the current state and ignores the sequence of the states preceding it. This property is called the Markov property or the memoryless property. 

- Higher Order models: also considers previous states of the sequence. The number of the previous states depends on the Order. For example, Second Order model would look back 2 steps in the sequence to calculate the probability of moving to the next state. 

### 3. Shapley Value method 

### 4. Logistic Regression method
